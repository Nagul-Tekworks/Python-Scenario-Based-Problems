# Python-Scenario-Based-Problems
This repository contains real-world Python exercises designed for the COE (Center of Excellence) program. Each scenario simulates a practical problem where students can apply functions, loops, conditions, and data structures to solve real-life tasks.
ðŸ“š Problem Scenarios

ATM Machine Simulator

Simulate an ATM machine with PIN verification, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.

Shopping Cart / Billing System

Build a supermarket billing system with discounts, GST, and multiple item selection.

Movie Ticket Booking System

Simulate a cinema ticket booking system with seat management, age restrictions, and GST.

Restaurant Ordering System

Create a restaurant ordering system with Veg/Non-Veg mode, free dessert rules, and billing.

Petrol Pump Billing System

Simulate petrol and diesel purchase with limits, discount rules, and receipt generation.

Library Management System

Build a library system to issue, return, and track borrowed books with fines for late returns.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

Functions: Modularize code and implement reusable logic.

Loops: Take repeated inputs for multiple transactions or selections.

Conditions: Apply real-world rules (limits, discounts, age restrictions, fines).

Data Structures: Work with lists, dictionaries, and nested data for storing items and records.

User Interaction: Design clear and formatted outputs for a real-world feel.

ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository

Open each .docx file to read the problem statement and rules.

Implement the solution in Python using your preferred IDE or online compiler.

(Optional) Create a solutions/ folder in the repo and add your Python scripts.

Test your code with multiple scenarios to ensure all rules are implemented.

ðŸ’¡ Tips for Students

Break the problem into functions for each task (e.g., calculate bill, withdraw money, issue book).

Always validate inputs before processing (e.g., PIN, age, quantities).

Use loops to allow multiple transactions/orders in a single run.

Format outputs neatly for better readability and user experience.
